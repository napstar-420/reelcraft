# Phase 9.5 — Visual Blueprint Canvas: implementation progress

Plan: `docs/plans/phase-9.5-visual-canvas.md`
Branch: `codex/phase9.5-visual-canvas`

## Chunks

- [x] Chunk 1 — Backend baseline + canvas skeleton
- [ ] Chunk 2 — Stage node CRUD (add / remove / reorder)
- [ ] Chunk 3 — Binding picker (the `Ref` editor)
- [ ] Chunk 4 — Inspector panel: capability config + slots/context
- [ ] Chunk 5 — Checks editor
- [ ] Chunk 6 — Remaining StageDef fields (qc, retryLimit, approval, budget, model, enabledWhen, iterate)
- [ ] Chunk 7 — Live validation overlay + memory-edge arcs
- [ ] Chunk 8 — Save, create-new flow, and dry-run integration
- [ ] Chunk 9 — Template library integration

## Notes / deviations from plan

### Chunk 1

- `POST /blueprints` added to `BlueprintController` wrapping
  `BlueprintService.ensureBlueprint` unchanged; `CreateBlueprintDto`
  (`{channelId, name}`) added to `packages/shared/src/dto/blueprint.dto.ts`
  next to the existing blueprint DTOs — already re-exported via the
  package's `dto/index.ts` barrel, no barrel change needed.
- `@xyflow/react@^12.11.6` added as a normal (non-dev) dependency of
  `apps/web`; confirmed compatible peer deps (`react`/`react-dom >=17`)
  against this repo's React 18.3.1. Installed via `pnpm install` at the
  repo root (lockfile updated by the tool, not hand-edited).
- The required `@xyflow/react/dist/style.css` stylesheet is imported once,
  directly in `apps/web/src/pages/BlueprintCanvasPage.tsx` (not
  `main.tsx`) since that page is currently the only consumer of the
  library.
- `apps/web/src/api/client.ts` gained `createBlueprint`,
  `createBlueprintVersion`, `listBlueprintVersions`, and
  `validateBlueprint`. All four were confirmed missing before this chunk.
  `CreateBlueprintVersionDto`, `BlueprintVersionDto`, and `ValidationIssue`
  all import cleanly from `@reefcraft/shared`'s root barrel — no path
  surprises.
- `BlueprintCanvasPage.tsx` handles both routes in one component,
  branching on which route param is present:
  - `/channels/:channelId/build` (create-new): renders a small
    "Name your blueprint" form; no blueprint is created until the user
    submits a name. On success, the created `blueprintId` is held in
    `useState` on the same component instance, which switches it straight
    into edit-mode rendering — no navigation/route change, so a page
    refresh before saving a version would lose the in-progress id (this
    is fine for Chunk 1, since there is nothing to lose yet — the created
    blueprint has zero versions either way).
  - `/blueprints/:blueprintId/build` (edit-existing): calls
    `listBlueprintVersions`, seeds the draft from the highest-`version`
    entry's `graph`/`inputs`/`roles`/`defaults`/`budget`, or an empty
    draft (`{graph: [], inputs: [], roles: [], defaults: {}, budget:
{runCapUsd: 5}}`) when the list is empty.
  - The draft is plain local `useState`, seeded once via a guarded
    `useEffect` (no React Query mutation) per the chunk's spec.
- Canvas rendering: one node per `graph` entry positioned at
  `{x: index * 250, y: 100}`, `prev` edges computed between consecutive
  entries, `ReactFlow` wrapped in `ReactFlowProvider`, all interactivity
  props (`nodesDraggable`/`nodesConnectable`/`elementsSelectable`) forced
  `false` since this chunk is read-only by design. Empty graph renders a
  static "Add your first stage…" message, no button.
- `apps/web/src/components/canvas/` was not created as an empty directory
  — git doesn't track empty directories and this chunk adds no files
  there; it will be created naturally when Chunk 2 adds `StageNode.tsx`.
- `BlueprintsPage.tsx` gained a "Create custom blueprint" link to
  `/channels/:channelId/build`, added alongside (not replacing) the
  existing template list.
- New e2e test `apps/api/test/e2e/blueprint-create.e2e.test.ts` mirrors
  `blueprint-validate.e2e.test.ts`'s style: drives `BlueprintController`
  directly via `testApp.app.get(BlueprintController)` (no HTTP/supertest
  anywhere in this repo's e2e suite), covering create-returns-id,
  idempotency by `(channelId, name)`, and a standalone
  `CreateBlueprintDto.safeParse` check for empty-name rejection (calling
  the controller method directly bypasses the `ZodValidationPipe`, so DTO
  validation itself is tested against the schema directly rather than
  through the controller).
- Verification: `pnpm install`, `pnpm --filter @reefcraft/shared build`,
  `pnpm --filter @reefcraft/api typecheck`, the new e2e test (3/3 passed),
  the full e2e regression suite (31 files / 176 tests, all passed),
  `pnpm --filter @reefcraft/web typecheck`/`build` (both clean), `pnpm
lint` (0 errors, 1 pre-existing unrelated warning in
  `media-output.e2e.test.ts`), and `pnpm format:check` (clean) — all run
  and all green.
